# test large number handling

# note: lil numbers are ultimately backed by doubles, which are nothing but trouble.
# this test is not necessarily about *accuracy*, it is about *consistency*.

on testnum x do
	show[x]
	show[fmt:"%j" format x]
	show[fus:"" fuse x]
	show[fmt~fus]
end

# a very cool number
testnum[-3.1337]

# a pretty big number (bigger than an int, for example)
testnum[100000000000]

# the biggest precise int in an ieee-754
testnum[9007199254740992]
