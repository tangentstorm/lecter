# things to do

- [x] enable danger zone
  - can call endanger() on any deck
  - lecter-deck.html has DANGEROUS=1 anyway
- [x] copy/port {ipcRdTxt, ipcWrTxt, ipcShell, ipcDir} from repl.js
- [x] expose these as window.ipcFoo() in the mainWorld (the page)
- [ ] write a danger-zone module to call the functions
  ```
  danger.js[src, callbacks]
  ```
